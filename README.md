# Time-Series-and-Sequence-Learning

**Welcome!** This repository contains my lab assignments from the **Time Series and Sequence Learning** course.

**What will you find here?**

* **Four Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb):** Each notebook represents a different lab assignment, covering the following topics:
    * **Lab 1 - Autoregressive Models:** Implementing autoregressive models to analyze time series data and make predictions based on past observations.
    * **Lab 2 - Structural Time Series and Kalman Filtering:** Exploring structural time series models and applying Kalman filtering techniques for state estimation and forecasting.
    * **Lab 3 - Nonlinear State Space Models and Sequential Monte Carlo:** Investigating nonlinear state space models and utilizing sequential Monte Carlo methods for inference and prediction tasks.
    * **Lab 4 - Recurrent Neural Networks:** Building and training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequence learning tasks, such as time series prediction, and sequence generation.

**Disclaimer:** This repository serves as a personal learning portfolio and does not claim to provide complete solutions or code for specific assignments. It is intended to showcase learning progress and applied skills in time series analysis and sequence learning techniques.
